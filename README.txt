fCC project written in single jQuery file. 

Struggled to seperate audio for same class. (App wouldn't pass tests with renamed 'equals' class... Dunno why, but time to move on). 
Probably also needs audio play stopped with consecutive, multiple key strokes. Also, some warning with favicon re. audio, but moving on. 
Outputting results in odd choice of exp format but it's an odd calculator. 
Simpler, no-warnings version: https://codepen.io/camalDan/pen/ZEaPqKb?editors=1001
